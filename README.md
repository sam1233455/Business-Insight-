 Project Overview
 
AtliQ Hardware is a fast-growing electronics company that operates in many countries. They used Excel to analyze data, but it wasn‚Äôt effective. Because of poor data analysis, they faced big losses in Latin America.
To fix this, company leaders decided to start a data analytics project. A team was assigned to build a dashboard that shows clear insights from departments like Sales, Finance, Marketing, and Supply Chain.
