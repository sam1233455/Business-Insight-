Business Project Overview
This is a project-based learning dashboard built using Power BI. We analyze various aspects of a fictional consumer electronics company, AtliQ Hardware, which operates across multiple countries.
The company has been facing challenges due to its reliance on Excel for data analysis. Limited insights and lack of real-time visibility into performance led to a significant business loss in Latin America. The goal of this project is to create a centralized interactive dashboard to support better decision-making in departments like Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain.

Problem Statement
AtliQ Hardware's data was scattered across Excel files, making it hard to gain actionable insights. They lacked proper tools and dashboards to monitor KPIs, track performance by region and department, and forecast future outcomes.

Centralize and visualize key business metrics.
Enable stakeholders to interact with and filter reports easily.
Identify performance gaps and improvement opportunities.
Forecast trends for the upcoming fiscal periods.
